# Background
During the development process, you will encounter a page that displays a variety of different styles of content, or dynamically displays a certain section. If you put them in VC, then VC will be very bloated and inconvenient to manage. Then this framework came into being to solve this problem.
This framework includes multi-page integration and matching, network requests, data buried points, asynchronous UI rendering, etc. Easy to use, just use VC inheritance.
